# cosc304project
A project made by me and a group of classmates for a school project. 
Built an eccomerce store using JSP, Bootstrap, HTML, docker and SQL databases.
The store contains many features you would expect form an eccomerce store, such as a login feature, 
landing page, account page, list of products, shipping page, a place to store all the values give from the user, 
and more.
Hosed on docker and uses SQL database to store important values such as login / registration features. 
This project rceived 100%, meaning it was fully functional and implemented all the tasks required of us.
